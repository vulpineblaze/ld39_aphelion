Use WASD to move your ship
Press Spacebar to fire absorption beam

-

Keep an eye on your Power bar, located at the top of the screen.
You must gather enough Power to maintain your ship
And enough extra to save what remains of the universe.

-

After a centillion years, heat death becomes an inevitability.
With almost no thermodynamic free energy left in the universe,
There is little hope for those who remain.

-

Although their light may still reach us,
All of the stars have collapsed into brilliant supernovae...
Only neutron husks and black holes punctuate the barren landscape.

-

Unable to gather resources outside of their home systems,
The younger and less intelligent races were the first to go,
Followed by those who could not harness nuclear fusion.

-

More advanced races began violating peace agreements,
Resorting to pillaging resources from more vulnerable populations 
In a desperate attempt at self-preservation.
-

Many groups and factions have gone rogue,
Leaving their home systems with everything they can carry,
Hoping to plunder or find enough energy to sustain their ships.

-

The universal economy is decimated.
There are no more trade routes or allies...
Only prospects.

-

As energy supplies dwindled, war became inescapable.
Races who had long-since been friends and allies turned on each other.
One by one, great and ancient civilizations fell.

-

Those peoples who remain have either given up hope,
Or are gambling the last of their resources to overtake the others...

-

Except for one.

-

We are a differently-minded people.
Highly intelligent, we surpass all others in technological advancement.
We knew this day would come.

-

A peaceful race, we opted not to pillage.
Instead we raised our defenses,
To develop and protect that which is most precious...

-

A device that would save our empire...
A device that would save our universe...
Our peoples' crowning achievement...

-

The Trans-Universal Warp Drive.

-

This device would allow us to explore the multiverse,
And therefore open the path to unlimited energy,
Saving our race from imminent annihilation.

-

However, we have run into a problem...
Energy reserves are low.
It is all we can do to maintain our defenses.

-

There is not enough left to power the Warp Drive,
While keeping our people safe from destruction.
Hostile forces loom just beyond our borders...

-

Waiting...

-

Left with no other option,
Our engineers installed the drive onto our greatest ship...
The Starseeker.

-

A grand ship,
Crewed by the best and brightest,
The Starseeker is the pride of the fleet.

-

Given all of the remaining free power in the Aphelion System,
The crew has been sent off into the barren wastes...
The guardians of the last hope for the universe.

-

Resources must be gathered to sustain the ship...
With enough leftover to power the Warp Drive,
And bring new resources back to the Aphelion system.

-

You, the Captain of the Starseeker, are in charge of this mission.
The fate of the universe rests in your capable hands.
Best of luck!

-

Welcome to the last days of the universe.
