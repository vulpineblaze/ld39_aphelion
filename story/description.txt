### Welcome to the last days of the universe.

It is a fundamental law of nature that all things which have a beginning, must eventually come to some sort of end. Although a centillion years is quite a good run for a universe, there is yet another law of nature that states, “Life always seeks a way keep on living.” This is evident in the evolution of a species over time. Animals adapt to rapid, dramatic environmental changes; Plants always eventually find their way through cracks in the concrete, despite all odds.

Even so, by now, most of the sentient life has died out. Their stars over time have burned up all of their helium, and collapsed into grand displays of supernovae. All that remains are densely-packed neutron stars and foreboding black holes dotting the otherwise vacant landscape.

The younger and less intelligent races were the first to go, not having yet discovered the technology to reach out to neighboring star systems. Those who had failed to master the art of sustained nuclear fusion soon followed. Eventually, the most advanced races became desperate for power, forsaking peace agreements with more vulnerable populations to absorb their resources in a desperate attempt at self-preservation.


War now ravages the universe, as the most technologically advanced species’ gamble their final energy supplies in an attempt to strip each other of what few resources remain.

**Life is tenacious.** 

The Sakari of the Aneurin system, especially so. A highly technologically advanced and predominantly peaceful race, they had long-since predicted this outcome. Instead of waging war, they opted to close their borders and direct their energy into bolstering their defenses in an attempt to protect that which is most precious to them - The Trans-Universal Warp Drive, a device that will allow them to explore the multiverse. 

Development has almost concluded, but unfortunately not quickly enough. The Sakari have used up the majority of their reserves trying to safely sustain their population, leaving nothing to spare to power the device, the last hope of the universe. With no other options left, they installed the drive onto their most capable ship, The Starseeker, and sent it off into the unknown.

The fate of Sakari, of the universe itself, rests in the collective hands of the crew of The Starseeker. They must acquire enough resources to power the warp drive, or else perish, and with them, the remaining life in the universe.

### You, the Captain of The Starseeker, are in charge of this vital mission.
